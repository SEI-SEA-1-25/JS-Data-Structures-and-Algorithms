- Fork and clone this repo
- Starter `.js` files have been provided for each part of this deliverable
- Have fun hacking!

## Part 1: Stack Data Structure in JS

---

You will need to create a `stack` data structure for this protion of the deliverable

You can use the `Stack.js` for your `Stack` class. The constructor of your `Stack` class will need to keep track of all data in the stack.

The `Stack` class will need the following methods:

| Method    | Functionality                                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `size`    | Returns the (int) size of the stack                             |
| `isEmpty` | Returns True if stack is empty, False otherwise                 |
| `push`    | Adds an item to the stack -- returns new size of the stack      |
| `pop`     | Removes an item from the stack -- returns new size of the stack |
| `peek`    | Returns the first item in the stack but doesn't remove it       |
| `print`   | Prints all items in the stack                                   |

## Part 2: Queue Data Structure in JS

---

You will need to create a `queue` data structure for this part of the deliverable

You can use `Queue.js` for your `Queue` class. The constructor of your `Queue` class will need to keep track of all data in the queue.

The `Queue` class will need the following methods:

| Method    | Functionality                                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `size`    | Returns the (int) size of the the queue                             |
| `isEmpty` | Returns True if the queue is empty, False otherwise                 |
| `enqueue` | Adds an item to the the queue -- returns new size of the queue      |
| `dequeue` | Removes an item from the the queue -- returns new size of the queue |
| `peek`    | Returns the first item in the the queue but doesn't remove it       |
| `print`   | Prints all items in the the queue                                   |

## Part 3: Implement Bubble Sort in JS

For this part of the deliverable, you will need to implement the `Bubble Sort` algorithm in Javascript.

There is a starter array of data in bubbleSort.js for you to use.

- _Don't use any built-in sort functions_
- _]The array must be sorted in place -- don't return a new array_
